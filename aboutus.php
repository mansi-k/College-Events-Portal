<h1>About this website</h1><br />This Website is a <h4>COLLEGE EVENT PORTAL</h4> which gives brief information of each and every event or any activity that takes place in our college.<br /><br />
The aim of this website is to provide every student a platform for interacting with other college authorities and other students.<br /><br />
Through this initiative we endeavour to provide for an easier interface that will enlighten everyone about the various happenings, events and other sessions/ seminars/ workshops to be conducted in our college.<br /><br />
There will also be a <h4>NEWS HOTLINE</h4> on the website that would flash all the latest announcements and news in the college with regards to admissions, examination dates, examination results, payment of fee and other incidental and collateral matters.<br /><br>
This website aims to be a handy tool for every student, parent or faculty member in order to be kept updated about the events in the college.<br /><br>
